ADVANCED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------

This module uses optional SEO keywords, which rewrites the URL displayed in the browser's address bar. In order for this to work, you need to do the following:

1. Rename .htaccess.txt to .htaccess
2. Make sure the the RewriteBase is pointed to the correct root folder where your site is installed.
3. Enabled SEO URLs in Admin > System > Settings > Store > Server > Use SEO URL's
4. The SEO Articles module will overwrite a system file (catalog/controller/common/seo_url.php), so you may wish to back it up first. Alternatively, you can just omit this file.


Finally, copy the downloaded admin and catalog folders onto your website's upload folder. Activate the module in Admin > Extensions > Modules > Articles.
